- Obsessional Directive quota no longer scales with difficulty

Opinion Modifiers:
- Fallen Empires dislike you 5x less for researching their tech if you aren't Cosmogenesis, since you aren't as much of a threat ;)

Galaxy Generation:
- All AI personality types have the same probability of being an advanced AI

Planet Classes:
- Gaia World gives an additional +5% happiness and job efficiency (totaling +15%) and give +10% pop assembly speed (machine and organic)
- Toxic Worlds can be terraformed directly to Gaia worlds if you have both APs

Policies:
- Added 2 new Mutual Aid trade policies, one for food and one for minerals, which give more of their resource and energy than the default policy (0.3 and 0.3 instead of 0.2, 0.2, and 0.2)
- Research Focus Policies from taking the Technological Ascendancy ascension perk now give a +100% draw chance and +5% type research speed if specialized

Jobs:
- Virtual Synthetic pops (but not Full Virtual pops) can be used in the Synthetic Lathe

Factions:
- Factions will now spawn after 1 year for all empires, regardless of if they've made contact with other empires, and will spawn immediately for Parliamentary System or Crowd Sourcing empires
