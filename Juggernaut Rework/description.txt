[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod reworks the Juggernaut and adds an alternative Juggernaut class, the Juggernaut CR, which lacks shipyards but has enhanced combat capabilities and can be slotted into fleets with other ships.

The following changes have been made to the Juggernaut (and the Juggernaut CR):
- Given 3 T slots and 2 modular sections that can be set as Carrier or Artillery sections, giving the Juggernaut orders of magnitude more firepower than any other ship
- Given more defensive utility slots
- Given a +75% multiplier to armor and shield health and a +50% multiplier to weapon damage
- Has 3 instead of 4 Aux slots

Additionally, the Juggernaut CR has the following changes from a regular Juggernaut:
- Designated as a ship instead of a starbase, allowing it to be added to fleets with other ships and equipped with Afterburners
- Shipyards are removed, but has a hull and armor repair aura to allow system-wide repairs
- Given an additional +75% multiplier to armor and shield health and a +50% multiplier to weapon damage (totaling +150% armor and shield health and +100% weapon damage respectively)

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod overwrites the Juggernaut (duhh), a few triggers related to the Juggernaut, and a few events related to the Juggernaut (files listed below). This mean's it's pretty unlikely it'll cause issues with any other mods unless they add to or modify Juggernaut functionality! ^-^
