[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod prevents cosmic storms from spawning naturally, regardless of galaxy generation settings (scripted storms should still spawn).

The reason I made a mod for this is because the mid-game storm settings are currently broken in the galaxy creation screen, so you can't properly disable storms without a mod :(

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod overwrites "cstorms.905" in "cosmic_storms_events_1.txt". That's all ^-^
