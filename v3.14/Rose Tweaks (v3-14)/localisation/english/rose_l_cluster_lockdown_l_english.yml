 ROSE_L_CLUSTER_LOCKDOWN: "Lock Down L-Cluster"
 ROSE_L_CLUSTER_LOCKDOWN_DESC: "With control over Terminal Egress, our scientists believe they have found a way to force all other L-Gates, save for one, to self-destruct. This would make the L-Cluster significantly easier to fortify if we choose to expand or even relocate there."

 rose_l_cluster_lockdown.3.name: "Lock Down L-Cluster"
 rose_l_cluster_lockdown.3.desc: "We are ready to lock down the L-Cluster. All we need to do now is choose which L-Gate to leave open, as to not repeat the mistakes of the Gate-Builders."
 rose_l_cluster_lockdown.3.a: "Leave open the §Y[rose_l_cluster_lockdown_lgate_option_1.GetName]§! system"
 rose_l_cluster_lockdown.3.b: "Leave open the §Y[rose_l_cluster_lockdown_lgate_option_2.GetName]§! system"

 rose_l_cluster_lockdown.4.name: "L-Cluster Locked Down"
 rose_l_cluster_lockdown.4.desc: "We have just learned that the §Y[from.GetName]§! has initiated some sort of lockdown on all L-Gates, causing all but one of them to self-destruct. This will make getting to the L-Cluster much more difficult."
