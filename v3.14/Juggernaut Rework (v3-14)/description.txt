[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod reworks the Juggernaut to be less of a crappy mobile shipyard, and more of a combat powerhouse. The following changes are made to the Juggernaut:
- Designated as a ship instead of a starbase, allowing them to be added to fleets with other ships
- Shipyards are removed, but a hull and armor repair aura is added to all Juggernaut auras to allow system-wide repairs
- Given 3 T slots and 2 modular sections that can be set as Carrier or Artillery sections, giving the Juggernaut orders of magnitude more firepower than any other ship
- Given more armor slots and a +100% multiplier to armor and shield health
- Has a innate modifier that makes weapons 50% more powerful
- Is capable of having Afterburners equipped to it, but has 3 Aux slots instead of 4 to compensate 

Additionally, the Juggernaut aura that improves orbital bombardment damage gives +100% instead of +30% damage

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod overwrites the Juggernaut (duhh), all of the Juggernaut's auras, and a few localisation lines (files listed below). This mean's it's pretty unlikely it'll cause issues with any other mods unless they add to or modify Juggernaut functionality! ^-^
