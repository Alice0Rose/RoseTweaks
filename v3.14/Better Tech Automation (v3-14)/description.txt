[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod adds a set of edicts that, when activated, remove their corresponding repeatable technologies from the pool of technologies that can be drawn. This allows you to enable tech automation in the late game without wasting the majority of your science production on technologies that are useless to you!

Note that there will always be a one tech delay between activation or deactivation of the edicts and their corresponding techs disappearing/reappearing, as the edicts only affect what techs are drawn after a tech has been completed.

The edicts will also only show up once you have the ability to research the technologies they would remove, as to not clog the edict menu in the early game ^-^

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Because of the way this mod works, it has to override every technologies that the edicts affect (by default, all the infinite repeatables and the Cosmogenesis level 5 entry tech). This means the mod requires a patch mod to work with other mods that modify these technologies or add other technologies. Below are some I have already created for my own mods and mods I regularly play with, which can be used as a template for creating your own patch mods :)
