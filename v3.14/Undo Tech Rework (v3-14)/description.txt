Undoes most of the changes that were part of the 3.11 Eridanus tech rework/rebalance ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ[/h1]

Changes include:
[list]
[*] Empires size effect on tech is brought back to 50% of what the effect on traditions is
[*] Research and related jobs have +1 to their base research production
[*] The 9 (3 per tech category) techs that give +20% researcher output to their corresponding type are back
[*] Research speed increases from the AI techs and the curators no longer increases researcher upkeep and the curators give +10% instead of +5% research speed
[/list]

To get the full effect, be sure to disable Difficulty Adjusted Tech Costs during world creation.
